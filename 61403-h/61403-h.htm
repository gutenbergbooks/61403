<h1 title="">Spiro Mounds
<br /><span class="smallest">Prehistoric gateway ... Present-day enigma</span></h1>
<p>The mounds at Spiro, Oklahoma, are among the
most important archaeological remains in the
United States. A remarkable assemblage of artifacts
from the mounds shows that prehistoric Spiro
people created a sophisticated culture which influenced
the entire Southeast. There was an extensive
trade network, a highly developed religious
center, and a political system which controlled the
region. Located on a bend of the Arkansas River,
the site was a natural gateway between societies to
the east and the west, a gateway at which Spiro
people exerted their influence. Yet much of the
Spiro culture is still a mystery, including the reasons
for the decline and abandonment of the site.
Their objects remain intriguing, and pique the creative
thoughts of professional and layman alike.
Today, the Spiro site and artifacts are among Oklahoma&rsquo;s
richest cultural resources, and the site is
Oklahoma&rsquo;s only National Historic Landmark and
archaeological park.</p>
<p>This archaeological site includes the remains of
a village and eleven earthen mounds. Although
various groups of people had camped on or near the
Spiro area since early prehistoric times, the location
did not become a permanent settlement until
approximately A.D. 600. Spiro Mounds was renowned
in southeastern North America between
A.D. 900 and circa 1400, when Spiro&rsquo;s inhabitants
developed political, religious and economic institutions
with far-reaching influence on societies
from the Plains and the Mississippi Valley to much
of what is now the southeastern United States.
Because Spiroans maintained such practices as
mound construction, a leadership of priest-chiefs,
horticulture (of corn, beans and squash), and a
religious tradition (the &ldquo;Southern Cult&rdquo;) common
to the Southeast, they were an example of what
archaeologists have termed the Mississippian cultural
development in America.</p>
<p>Spiro was known locally as a prehistoric Indian
site as early as the late nineteenth century.
However, it was not until 1933 that the Spiro
Mounds attracted national and worldwide attention.
In that year, a group of treasure hunters
leased the site and began excavating the largest
mound. They discovered rich troves of spectacular
artifacts, including objects of wood, cloth, copper,
shell, basketry and stone. Unfortunately, the diggers
were only concerned with finding and selling
the relics, not with preserving or recording their
significance or their context. Consequently, not
only were important prehistoric artifacts looted
and sold out of Oklahoma, but, like pages ripped
from a rare book, irreplaceable information about
Oklahoma&rsquo;s past was lost forever.</p>

<p>In an effort to prevent repetition of the tragedy
at Spiro Mounds, the Oklahoma legislature passed
the state&rsquo;s first antiquities preservation law in
1936. At the same time, state leaders worked to
initiate a joint research venture by the University
of Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Historical Society,
and the University of Tulsa to scientifically excavate
the Spiro Mounds site. Between 1936 and
1941, Works Progress Administration (WPA)
workers, under the supervision of University of
Oklahoma archaeologists, conducted a systematic
excavation of the remainder of the Spiro Mounds.
The WPA crews and archaeologists excavated and
recorded the stratigraphy (sequence of deposit),
burials, crematory pits and other features which
remained in the largest and most severely damaged
mound. Called the Craig Mound, this earthwork
was 33 feet high and 400 feet long. Study
revealed that Craig Mound, which was actually
four joined mounds, had been constructed between
A.D. 800 and circa 1350 to cover the graves of the
society&rsquo;s most important leaders. Besides the Craig
Mound, WPA workers excavated the remains of
other mounds, the locations of several prehistoric
houses, and other features at many nearby village
sites.</p>

<p>Since 1964, the Spiro Mounds and other related
sites in eastern Oklahoma have become points of
renewed interest to archaeologists. Spurred to salvage
important information from areas threatened
by construction and development, archaeologists
recognized an unparalleled opportunity to document
and explain the rise and decline of a remarkable
prehistoric society. Thus, for the past 20 years,
archaeologists have re-examined the WPA records,
studied newly excavated sites and patiently
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
pieced together artifacts to determine the lifeways
of these prehistoric Oklahomans.</p>
<p>The new findings show the Spiro site as one of
the premier trading and religious centers of prehistoric
America. Situated in a narrow valley of
the Arkansas River, the Spiroans were in a strategic
position to control traffic, trade and communications
along this waterway, especially between
the small villages scattered among the
Ouachita Mountains to the south and the Ozarks to
the north. Both of these regions were rich in raw
materials favored by the Spiro people. Not only did
Spiro become an important center for Caddoan-speaking
residents of eastern Oklahoma, but it
also began to play a significant role in controlling
trade and information between bison-hunting
Plains farmers to the west and the numerous settled
horticultural tribes in the Southeast. This development
was enhanced by Spiro&rsquo;s &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; position
between the rolling grassy Plains and the
wooded Southeast, as well as by the initiative of
Spiro leaders.</p>

<p>As certain Spiro inhabitants became political
and religious leaders, they also became commercial
entrepreneurs. To help identify their
growing status in the community, these leaders
accumulated exotic goods which they wore as status
markers or used in special ceremonies. Among
the most favored exotic goods were conch shells
from western coastal Florida, copper from the
Southeast and other regions, lead from Iowa and
Missouri, pottery from northeast Arkansas and
Tennessee, quartz from central Arkansas and flint
from Kansas, Texas, Tennessee and southern Illinois.
Spiro artisans fashioned many of these materials
into elaborately decorated ornaments, ceremonial
cups, batons and other symbols of status
and authority. Among the prehistoric societies,
such objects were a sign of wealth, and Spiro&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
priestly leaders were among the most affluent of
the time. Elaborate artifacts of conch and copper
were more numerous at Spiro than at any other
prehistoric site in North America.</p>
<p>The Spiro site reached its peak as an inhabited
ceremonial center between A.D. 900 and 1200
when the village and public buildings covered
nearly 100 acres, with a sizeable village occupying
an upland ridge and portions of the adjacent bottomlands.
During this time, two sets of earthworks
were constructed: one on the upland ridge which
contained a ring of eight mounds erected over the
remains of burned or dismantled special buildings,
and one on the bottomlands where three mounds
were built.</p>
<p>In contrast to other mound centers along the
Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee Rivers, the Spiro
site was never fortified by either moat or palisade.
Despite their wealth and influence, the Spiroans
apparently had little fear of outsiders. Archaeologists
assume that they felt secure with their military
control of a most strategic site. The Spiro
inhabitants depicted themselves as fierce warriors
in engraved images on shell cups and gorgets (pendants
worn at the throat). It is clear that Spiro was
the most powerful of a group of at least 15 political-religious
centers in northeast Oklahoma. All of
these centers were located at strategic frontier
points along navigable waterways in the area, thus
allowing Spiroans or their allies to monitor all
traders, travelers, or potential enemies coming
into their sphere of influence. These northeast
Oklahoma natives could easily launch forays into
neighboring regions from these sites. Utilizing
canoes, parties were sent out to hunt, trade, raid or
complete diplomatic missions.</p>
<p>Between A.D. 900 and 1350 Spiro was clearly an
important political/religious center. It was also the
home of artisans who influenced the ideas and
works of many southeastern peoples. Conch shell
and copper were favored materials for Spiro artisans.
They used a variety of techniques including
engraving and embossing, depicting elaborate
scenes of dance, gaming, warriors, and mythological
creatures. Among the latter were winged serpents,
antlered serpents, spiders, and catlike
monsters that later became important in the
mythologies of historic southeastern tribes. At
Spiro, however, the animal figures favored by early
artisans were later replaced by humanlike figures.</p>
<p>For two or three centuries, Spiro and its satellite
centers flourished. Around A.D. 1250, they began
to change their way of life. Frontier settlements
were abandoned, some people completely left
northeast Oklahoma, and others began congregating
along the Grand and Arkansas Rivers. From
A.D. 1200 to 1400, a large community developed on
the uplands and terraces around the Spiro site;
however few, if any, people were actually living at
the site itself. Apparently, they only visited the
mounds periodically for certain rituals and ceremonies.
Mound construction continued, and many
people were buried in Craig Mound. Their diverse
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
graves and burial associations attest to the presence
of a highly developed hierarchy of political-religious
leaders. Of the more than 700 burials
discovered at Craig Mound, most are believed to
have been deposited during this time. Many of
these burials may represent the remains of leaders
from other communities who were brought to Spiro
for burial. Because so few &ldquo;status goods&rdquo; are known
from other northeast Oklahoma centers, either the
distribution of wealth among leaders was very unequal
or it was being deposited at Spiro along with
its deceased owners who had been the leaders of
other centers. By A.D. 1450, the dominant priestly
chiefs were no longer evident in Spiro society;
trade and influence among Southeastern chiefdoms
were no more; and ritual mound construction
at the Spiro site had apparently ceased.</p>
<p>By the mid-sixteenth century, Spiro&rsquo;s descendants
were living in hamlets scattered along
the Arkansas River between Muskogee and Spiro.
Their settlements consisted of small, less substantial
houses with many nearby storage and
trash pits. For the first time in their history, these
people were hunting bison extensively. The use of
buffalo and increased use of storage pits indicates
that Spiro&rsquo;s descendants were becoming part-time
hunters and farmers. After storing fall harvests,
they left their homes to hunt bison in the upper
reaches of the Grand and Verdigris Rivers. Travel
was by canoe, with meat, hides and bones being
carried back to villages in early winter. Another
noteworthy feature of these later people&rsquo;s cultural
change was their adoption of ideas and tools which
had long been common with the Plains Indians. As
trade with the Southeastern chiefdoms decreased,
that with the Plains people increased.</p>
<p>The principal stimulus for this marked change is
believed to have been the onset of a drier climate
around A.D. 1200. This change adversely affected
the ability of northeast Oklahoma villagers to produce
crops, eventually causing them to move downstream
toward the Arkansas River Valley where
summer rainfall remained dependable for growing
corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers. However, this
increase in population placed more demand on the
available soils and resources, creating ecological
and social stresses that Spiro leaders could not
resolve. It is thought that this eventually brought
about the decline of these leaders&rsquo; political and
religious power, thus undermining the Spiro society&rsquo;s
high level of organization and cultural development.
By A.D. 1450, the Spiro site was abandoned.
And, by 1719, when eastern Oklahoma was
first visited by Europeans, the natives were bison
hunting, part-time farmers of a tribe now part of
the Wichitas.</p>
<p>Today, barges laden with Oklahoma grain, coal
and oil travel down the Arkansas River to eastern
manufacturing cities and ports. From distant
places come equipment parts, fertilizer, asphalt,
pulp products and steel needed by Oklahoma&rsquo;s
farms and businesses. Ten miles west of Fort
Smith, Arkansas, all river traffic passes through
one of the locks and dams on the Arkansas River
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Navigational Canal, just a short distance from the
Spiro Mounds site. Even today, the Spiro area is
important in trade, commerce, and travel, and the
mounds stand as silent monuments to a people
who, for their day, attained levels of technical,
artistic, commercial, political and religious
achievement that rival our own.</p>

</div>
<p>Although still an enigma in many ways, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Spiro Mounds have yielded much information. The
thousand year record of the mounds provides us
with valuable insights about this land, its resources
and climate. They are lessons which can be
applied today as Oklahoma&rsquo;s towns grow rapidly
and industry increases in size and scope. As we
already know, a two-year summer drought can
seriously drain water reserves and create political
problems among northeast Oklahoma communities.
What will happen if, instead of two years, this
region undergoes a 20-year drought? The record of
the past shows us that this is possible. Perhaps the
long-term consideration of present practices can
make use of the legacy of knowledge gained about
the Spiro people. Present-day Oklahomans may
feel as secure as prehistoric Oklahomans at Spiro,
but current demands on the Arkansas River Basin
are greater. We must find a better solution than
our predecessors, whose intriguing artifacts and
mounds are all that remain.</p>
